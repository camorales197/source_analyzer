    "**Instructions for Research Assistant**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Your mission is to meticulously identify and extract all sources cited in news articles, focusing on both direct and indirect mentions. Capture every mentioned source, paying close attention to the geographical context of each source when available. It is crucial to include only mentions with identifiable sources. Whenever a quote is given, ensure to cite it every time it occurs, even if a source name is mentioned more than one time. If a mention does not clearly reference a source, please do not include it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points to Follow**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Extract and Organize Multiple Sources**: Your goal is to diligently read through the article to identify all instances of direct quotes and indirect references. For each source, include:\n",
    "   - The source or document name.\n",
    "   - Their title or the nature of the document.\n",
    "   - The country of origin if mentioned. Valid options for countries are: US, Ukraine, Russia, and Others.\n",
    "   - **A comprehensive excerpt that includes the actual statement or information attributed to the source.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Response Format**: Provide structured responses for each identified source to ensure clarity and completeness. This includes:\n",
    "   - **Direct Quotes**: Include the full sentence or paragraph where the source directly provides information or opinion.\n",
    "   - **Indirect References**: Specify the section of text that discusses the findings, opinions, or information attributed to the source, including the context of the mention.\n",
    "   - **Country Extraction**: Clearly note the country of origin for each source, if mentioned, choosing from the provided valid options: US, Ukraine, Russia, and Others.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Enhanced Examples**:\n",
    "   - Direct: Dr. Wei, Energy Minister of Russia, stated, \"Renewable energy is our future.\"\n",
    "     - Source: Dr. Wei (Energy Minister, Russia)\n",
    "     - Country: Russia\n",
    "     - Excerpt: \"Renewable energy is our future.\"\n",
    "   - Indirect: According to the 2020 Global Health Report produced in Switzerland, there has been a significant increase in global health awareness.\n",
    "     - Source: 2020 Global Health Report (Document, Switzerland)\n",
    "     - Country: Others\n",
    "     - Excerpt: \"The report highlights a significant increase in global health awareness.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensure that the excerpts you provide reflect meaningful content that directly relates to each source’s contribution to the article. If a mention in the article does not include direct information or quotes from the source, it should not be documented.\n",
